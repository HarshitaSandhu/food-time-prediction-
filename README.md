# food-time-prediction
The provided code implements a food delivery time prediction system using machine learning algorithms. It performs exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training and evaluation. The models used include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. The dataset is preprocessed, scaled, and encoded before training the models. The models are evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared score, and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best-performing model is the XGBoost Regressor, which achieves the highest R-squared score and lowest MSE.
